My name is Yu Lu and welcome to my website! 

I'm a first year PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, where I'm working with <a href="https://www.ziangxiao.com/">Prof. Ziang Xiao</a>. Previously, I was a Master's student at <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html">Prof. Jackie Chi Kit Cheung</a>. I also had the opportunity to work with collaborators (and mentors!) from Microsoft Research Montreal: <a href="https://www.aolteanu.com/">Dr. Alexandra Olteanu</a> and 
<a href="https://sblodgett.github.io/">Dr. Su Lin Blodgett</a>. Before my master’s studies, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/programs/b-sc/honours-statistics-and-computer-science-b-sc">(Honours) Statistics and Computer Science at McGill University</a>, and I also served as the Co-President (2021-2022) of <a href="https://mcgillai.com/">McGill Artificial Intelligence Society</a>.

<b> RESEARCH INTERESTS: Broadly speaking, I'm interested in evaluating how AI systems impact people and how people impact AI systems. I do focus more on (but do not limit myself to) natural language processing. More specifically, I'm interested in:
- How do people interact with these systems, how are people impacted by the use of these systems, by development/research practices in AI/NLP?
- How do people develop these systems, or conduct research in the field of AI/NLP?

The best way to reach me is via email (yliu624 [at] jh [dot] edu) or [Bluesky](@liuyulu.bsky.social).

<sub><i>About my name: “Yu Lu” is my given name and “Liu” is my family name. You can pronounce my given name by saying “you lunatic!” and then omit the “natic” part. It’s a 70% correct pronunciation and I’ve gotten quite used to it! That being said, I’ll be very happy if you get 100% by focusing on the last two characters of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL_mhbk2nyA">this Chinese idiom</a>.</sub></i>
